### 🧐 About 
Hey, glad you landed on this part of the Internet. I'm a Full Stack NLP Engineer. Apart from having the superpower of sitting at a desk and coding out a potential solution for more than 24 hrs to deliver something that makes my team happy and the world a better place, I am working on building scalable AI products for companies like P&G, SAP, and Google in domains like Search, Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems.

When I'm not in front of the screen, I can be found trying an open-sourced tool, reading/writing research papers, technical books, and write-ups. Let's connect and see how we can work together to change the world, one line of code at a time.
